# SeeItCorrectItNowMakeIt

This assignment will be completed in pairs. In this assignment you will be asked to analyze and improve a website based on the “PACT” assignment you should have delivered earlier this semester. If you have not done this assignment, you will have to do that before you can move forward. There are three steps to this assignment.

Step 1: Find a partner

Step 2: Choose which PACT assignment to base your improvements on. If you or your partner has not completed the PACT assignment, this person has to do the PACT assignment and deliver it alongside the link to the website. If neither of you have completed the PACT assignment, you will have to do this separately and deliver both along with the rest of this assignment.

Step 3: Visually analyze the website in the attachment below. Keep in mind your persona from the “PACT” assignment and think of ways this website would be hard for that persona to use the website. This includes both visual and functional elements of the website. 

Step 4: Come up with at least five ideas on how to improve this website in order to make it more user friendly for the persona you created in the “PACT” assignment

Step 5: Recreate the website according to the analysis from Step 3 and the solutions from Step 4. This means you may have to change the way the website looks visually and the way it operates functionally in order to improve the experience of the persona that you created in the “PACT” assignment. Make sure that all of the 5 solutions from step 4 are included in the website. 

After completing all the steps, you will submit one word-document or pdf that includes the link to your improved website, the name and student number for you and your partner, the analysis from Step 3 and the solutions from Step 4. If you or your partner have not submitted the “PACT” assignment, you must also include this assignment as an appendix in the word-document. If you have not completed the PACT assignment before its due date and failed to include it as an appendix, you will not pass this assignment, and will have to resubmit. Regardless of whether you’ve previously submitted the PACT assignment, you can only receive 2 points for this assignment.
